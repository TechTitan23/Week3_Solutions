Write a Python class named Car with attributes make, model, and year. Also, provide a method display_info to display the details of the car. 
Solution:

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
    
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Car Details:")
        print(f"Make: {self.make}")
        print(f"Model: {self.model}")
        print(f"Year: {self.year}")

make = input("Enter the make of the car: ")
model = input("Enter the model of the car: ")
year = input("Enter the year of the car: ")

car = Car(make, model, year)

car.display_info()
