Write a program to find the factorial of a number using functions
Solution:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

num = int(input("Enter a number:"))
if num < 0:
    print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
elif num == 0:
    print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
    result = factorial(num)
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")

def is_palindrome(num):
    # Convert the number to a string and check if it's equal to its reverse
    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]
